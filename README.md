# -Malaria-Detection-Project


Malaria is one of the deadliest diseases across the globe. This is caused by the bite of female Anopheles mosquito that transmits the Plasmodium parasites. Some current malaria detection techniques include manual microscopic examination and RDT. Red cell receptors provide unique entry points for Plasmodium parasites to initiate blood-stage malaria infection. by focusing on these receptors we are trying to minimize time complexity to identify the existence of malaria.
